It all looks the same to the neural net as we have it for now; it won’t distinguish between the order of words/tokens in our input. We’ll address this by creating another layer of embeddings, our positional embeddings with dimension [max_length, embedding_dim].\nFor each position embedding, we’ll chose the same length as our embedding_dim, so that we can add each of the respective positional vector to each of the corresponding token embedding vector.\nSo in terms of dimensions, we have: - [max_length, embedding dim] as our single sample input embedding vector. - [max_length, embedding dim] as our position embedding vector\nIt’s those two we’ll add together to form our input to the LLM.\nLet’s start from our batch again, using somewhat more realistic sizes and dimensions:\n\ncontext_length = 4          # Maximum length of the input sequences\nvocab_size = 50257          # Size of the vocabulary for GPT-2\nembedding_dim = 256         # Let's say we want 256-dimensional embeddings\n\nembedding_layer = torch.nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)\n\ndataloader = create_dataloader(txt=text, batch_size=2, max_length=context_length, stride=2, drop_last=True)\ndata_iter = iter(dataloader)\ninputs, targets = next(data_iter)\n\nprint(\"First batch of inputs and targets:\")\nprint(\"Inputs shape:\", inputs.shape)            # Shape: (batch_size, max_length)\nprint(\"Targets shape:\", targets.shape)          # Shape: (batch_size, max_length)\n\n# Get the embeddings for the input tokens\nembeddings = embedding_layer(inputs)            # Shape: (batch_size, max_length, embedding_dim)\nprint(\"Embeddings shape:\", embeddings.shape)    # Shape: (batch_size, max_length, embedding_dim)\n\n# Get the embedding layer for the positions\npos_embedding_layer = torch.nn.Embedding(context_length, embedding_dim)\npos_embeddings = pos_embedding_layer(torch.arange(context_length))  # Shape: (context_length, embedding_dim)\nprint(\"Position embeddings shape:\", pos_embeddings.shape)           # Shape: (context_length, embedding_dim)\n\n# Combine input embeddings and position embeddings\ncombined_embeddings = embeddings + pos_embeddings                   # Shape: (batch_size, max_length, embedding_dim)\nprint(\"Combined embeddings shape:\", combined_embeddings.shape)  # Shape: (batch_size, max_length, embedding_dim)\n\nFirst batch of inputs and targets:\nInputs shape: torch.Size([2, 4])\nTargets shape: torch.Size([2, 4])\nEmbeddings shape: torch.Size([2, 4, 256])\nPosition embeddings shape: torch.Size([4, 256])\nCombined embeddings shape: torch.Size([2, 4, 256])\n\n\nThis means that in our first batch we have: - 2 samples - each 4 tokens - each represented by an embedding vector of 256",

The most optimal encoding for \\(P\\) is given by its entropy \\(H(P)\\). Any other encoding will need more bits to convey the same events or observations. How many more bits would we need to encode information using the most optimal encoding for distribution Q, given information coming from distribution P?\nIn P, a single event or observation \\(x_{i}\\) with probability \\(p(x_{i})\\) needs \\(-log \\, p(x_{i})\\) bits to be encoded. That same event has a different probability in distribution Q and needs \\(-log \\, q(x_{i})\\) bits to be encoded in the optimal encoding for Q. The difference between the encoding for the same event in both distributions is: \\(-log \\, q(x_{i})-(-log \\, p(x_{i}))\\) or: \\[log \\, p(x_{i})-log \\, q(x_{i})\\]\nThe above equation tells us the “excess bits” for a single event \\(x_{i}\\) when encoded in Q instead of in P. To look at the average difference in number of bits across the entire distribution \\(P\\), we can multiply each event by its probably of occuring in P.

    "text": "3.3 Further intuition\nImagine we have 2 coins: one fair coin with an equal distribution of 0.5 for each outcome (heads or tails) and a biased coin with probability \\(p\\) for heads and \\(q\\) for tails. We’re trying to measure how different those are. If \\(p\\) is close to 0.5 then it would be easy to confuse both distributions by looking at the outcomes they generate. On the opposite side, if \\(p\\) is close to 0.95 for example, then it would be fairly obvious to dinstinguish between both distributions by observing a series of outcomes.\nTo quantitatively measure the difference between two distributions we can look if a given sequence would be equally probably in both. If they assign similar probabilities to similar sequences that implies both are very similar.\nWe can generate observations using coin 1 then calculating the probability of coin 2 generating the observations. Then we can compare that probability to the probability of coin 1. If those are similar, then the distribution is similar or vice versa. We could then take the following ratio: \\[\\frac{P_{\\text{observations from coin 1}}}{P_{\\text{observations from coin 2}}}\\]\nLet’s say our fair coin has probabilities: \\[\\begin{cases}p_{1} & \\text{for heads} \\\\ p_{2} & \\text{for tails} \\end{cases}\\]\nWe flip this coin \\(n\\) times: H T T H H\nThen we work out the probability of coin 1 generating this sequence. To do this we multiply by \\(p_{1}\\) when we see heads and by \\(p_{2}\\) when we see tails: \\(p_{1} \\cdot p_{2} \\cdot p_{2} \\cdot p_{1} \\cdot p_{1}\\)\nOur biased coin has probabilities: \\[\\begin{cases}q_{1} & \\text{for heads} \\\\ q_{2} & \\text{for tails} \\end{cases}\\]\nLet’s work out the probably of coin 2 generating this sequence. In a similar way this is: \\(q_{1} \\cdot q_{2} \\cdot q_{2} \\cdot q_{1} \\cdot q_{1}\\)\nIf \\(N_{H}\\) is the number of times we got heads and \\(N_{T}\\) is the number of times we got tails, we can simplify both as: \\[P(\\text{observations from coin 1})=p_{1}^{N_{H}}\\cdot p_{2}^{N_{T}}\\] and in the biased distribution: \\[P(\\text{observations from coin 2})=q_{1}^{N_{H}}\\cdot q_{2}^{N_{T}}\\]\nCalculating the ratio of both:\n\\[\\frac{P_{\\text{observations from coin 1}}}{P_{\\text{observations from coin 2}}}=\\frac{p_{1}^{N_{H}}p_{2}^{N_{T}}}{q_{1}^{N_{H}}q_{2}^{N_{T}}}\\]\nLet’s normalize this for sample size by raising this to the power of \\(\\frac{1}{N}\\): \\[\\left(\\frac{p_{1}^{N_{H}}p_{2}^{N_{T}}}{q_{1}^{N_{H}}q_{2}^{N_{T}}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{N}}\\]\nNow let’s take the log of this expression:\n\\[log \\left(\\frac{p_{1}^{N_{H}}p_{2}^{N_{T}}}{q_{1}^{N_{H}}q_{2}^{N_{T}}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{N}}\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{N} log \\left(\\frac{p_{1}^{N_{H}}p_{2}^{N_{T}}}{q_{1}^{N_{H}}q_{2}^{N_{T}}}\\right)\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{N} \\left( log\\,p_{1}^{N_{H}} + log\\,p_{2}^{N_{T}} - log\\,q_{1}^{N_{H}} -  log\\,q_{2}^{N_{T}} \\right)\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{N}log\\,p_{1}^{N_{H}} + \\frac{1}{N}log\\,p_{2}^{N_{T}} - \\frac{1}{N}log\\,q_{1}^{N_{H}} - \\frac{1}{N}log\\,q_{2}^{N_{T}}\\] \\[=\\frac{N_{H}}{N}log\\,p_{1} + \\frac{N_{T}}{N}log\\,p_{2} - \\frac{N_{H}}{N}log\\,q_{1} - \\frac{N_{T}}{N}log\\,q_{2}\\] \\[=p_{1}log\\,p_{1} + p_{2}log\\,p_{2} - p_{1}log\\,q_{1} - p_{2}log\\,q_{2}\\] \\[=p_{1}log\\,p_{1} - p_{1}log\\,q_{1} + p_{2}log\\,p_{2} - p_{2}log\\,q_{2}\\] \\[=p_{1}log\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}} + p_{2}log\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}\\]\nNote how this formula is the formula for KL divergence.",

    "text": "1 What is Softmax?\nSoftmax is a transformation, when applied to range of logits (the outputs of a neural network layer), turns their real values into probabilities that:\n\ntogether sum up to one\neach sit between \\(0\\ldots 1\\)\n\nOften, for classification tasks, it will be used as the final output layer of a neural network.\nImagine outputs \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\), …\nThe softmax for one of these numbers \\(x_{i}\\) is: \\[s(x_{i}) = \\frac{e^{x_{i}}}{ \\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{x_{j} }}\\]\nLook at the function \\(e^{x}\\) plotted out:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOberve that this function maps x from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\) to a range between \\(0\\ldots1\\). It also “encourages” large values proportionally more than small values.\n\n\n2 Relation to Cross-Entropy Loss\nRecall the formula for Cross-Entropy Loss, as outlined in Cross-Entropy Loss:\n\\[\\mathcal{L} = -\\sum_{c=1}^{M} y_c \\log(p_c)\\] where:\n\n\\(M\\) is the number of categories\n\\(y_c\\) is the ground truth (one-hot)\n\\(p_c\\) is the predicated probability for class c (after applying softmax)\n\n\\[\\mathcal{L} = -[ y_1 log(p_1) + y_2 log(p_2) + ... + y_M log(p_M) ] \\]\nhowever, for only one single category the ground truth \\(y_{\\text{true}}\\) will be \\(1\\) for all the others, the ground truth \\(y_i\\) will be \\(0\\). This means we can further simplify this to:\n\\[\\mathcal{L} =  -[ y_{\\text{true}} log(p_\\text{true})] \\]",
