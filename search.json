    "text": "1 What is Softmax?\nSoftmax is a transformation, when applied to range of logits (the outputs of a neural network layer), turns their real values into probabilities that:\n\ntogether sum up to one\neach sit between \\(0\\ldots 1\\)\n\nOften, for classification tasks, it will be used as the final output layer of a neural network.\nImagine outputs \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\), …\nThe softmax for one of these numbers \\(x_{i}\\) is: \\[s(x_{i}) = \\frac{e^{x_{i}}}{ \\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{x_{j} }}\\]\nLook at the function \\(e^{x}\\) plotted out:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOberve that this function maps x from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\) to a range between \\(0\\ldots1\\). It also “encourages” large values proportionally more than small values.\n\n\n2 Relation to Cross-Entropy Loss\nRecall the formula for Cross-Entropy Loss, as outlined in Cross-Entropy Loss:\n\\[\\mathcal{L} = -\\sum_{c=1}^{M} y_c \\log(p_c)\\] where:\n\n\\(M\\) is the number of categories\n\\(y_c\\) is the ground truth (one-hot)\n\\(p_c\\) is the predicated probability for class c (after applying softmax)\n\n\\[\\mathcal{L} = -[ y_1 log(p_1) + y_2 log(p_2) + ... + y_M log(p_M) ] \\]\nhowever, for only one single category the ground truth \\(y_{\\text{true}}\\) will be \\(1\\) for all the others, the ground truth \\(y_i\\) will be \\(0\\). This means we can further simplify this to:\n\\[\\mathcal{L} =  -[ y_{\\text{true}} log(p_\\text{true})] \\]",

It all looks the same to the neural net as we have it for now; it won’t distinguish between the order of words/tokens in our input. We’ll address this by creating another layer of embeddings, our positional embeddings with dimension [max_length, embedding_dim].\nFor each position embedding, we’ll chose the same length as our embedding_dim, so that we can add each of the respective positional vector to each of the corresponding token embedding vector.\nSo in terms of dimensions, we have: - [max_length, embedding dim] as our single sample input embedding vector. - [max_length, embedding dim] as our position embedding vector\nIt’s those two we’ll add together to form our input to the LLM.\nLet’s start from our batch again, using somewhat more realistic sizes and dimensions:\n\ncontext_length = 4          # Maximum length of the input sequences\nvocab_size = 50257          # Size of the vocabulary for GPT-2\nembedding_dim = 256         # Let's say we want 256-dimensional embeddings\n\nembedding_layer = torch.nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)\n\ndataloader = create_dataloader(txt=text, batch_size=2, max_length=context_length, stride=2, drop_last=True)\ndata_iter = iter(dataloader)\ninputs, targets = next(data_iter)\n\nprint(\"First batch of inputs and targets:\")\nprint(\"Inputs shape:\", inputs.shape)            # Shape: (batch_size, max_length)\nprint(\"Targets shape:\", targets.shape)          # Shape: (batch_size, max_length)\n\n# Get the embeddings for the input tokens\nembeddings = embedding_layer(inputs)            # Shape: (batch_size, max_length, embedding_dim)\nprint(\"Embeddings shape:\", embeddings.shape)    # Shape: (batch_size, max_length, embedding_dim)\n\n# Get the embedding layer for the positions\npos_embedding_layer = torch.nn.Embedding(context_length, embedding_dim)\npos_embeddings = pos_embedding_layer(torch.arange(context_length))  # Shape: (context_length, embedding_dim)\nprint(\"Position embeddings shape:\", pos_embeddings.shape)           # Shape: (context_length, embedding_dim)\n\n# Combine input embeddings and position embeddings\ncombined_embeddings = embeddings + pos_embeddings                   # Shape: (batch_size, max_length, embedding_dim)\nprint(\"Combined embeddings shape:\", combined_embeddings.shape)  # Shape: (batch_size, max_length, embedding_dim)\n\nFirst batch of inputs and targets:\nInputs shape: torch.Size([2, 4])\nTargets shape: torch.Size([2, 4])\nEmbeddings shape: torch.Size([2, 4, 256])\nPosition embeddings shape: torch.Size([4, 256])\nCombined embeddings shape: torch.Size([2, 4, 256])\n\n\nThis means that in our first batch we have: - 2 samples - each 4 tokens - each represented by an embedding vector of 256",

    "text": "1.1 Simplified Self-Attention\nLet’s take a simple sentence: “I am learning this”\nThis is our input sequencen let’s call it \\(x\\) with 4 tokens: \\(x^{(1)}\\), \\(x^{(2)}\\), \\(x^{(3)}\\) and \\(x^{(4)}\\).\nIn general if our context length is \\(T\\) then we have \\(x^{(1)} \\ldots x^{(T)}\\)\nEach \\(x^{(i)}\\) is a \\(d\\)-dimensional embedding vector representing a token.\nNow we will calculate a context vector \\(z^{i}\\) for each \\(x^{i}\\). This vector will contain information from all vectors \\(x^{(1)} \\ldots x^{(T)}\\)\n\n1.1.1 Attention scores\nSo, for example, for \\(x^{(3)}\\) we’ll calculate a context vector \\(z^{(3)}\\). We’ll call \\(x^{(3)}\\) our “query” vector and for this query we’ll calculate an attention score for each of the tokens in our sentence: for example \\(w_{31}\\) for the attention score between our query (the 3rd token) and the first token. In this way we’ll have: \\(w_{31}\\), \\(w_{32}\\), \\(w_{33}\\) and \\(w_{34}\\)\nThe attention score \\(w_{31}\\) is the dot product from the third token with the first token. So if: \\[ x^{(3)} = [0.2,0.7,0.9] \\text{  (representing the token \"learning\")} \\] \\[ x^{(1)} = [0.8,0.9,0.3] \\text{  (representing the token \"I\")} \\]\nThen:\n\\[w_{(31)} = x^{(3)} \\cdot x^{(1)} = [(.2*.8) + (.7*.9) + (.9 * .3)] = 1.06 \\]\nWe’ll do this between our query \\(x^{(3)}\\) and each of our \\(x^{(1)},x^{(2)},x^{(3)},x^{(4)}\\) which result in an attention vector \\(w_3 = [ w_{(31)},w_{(32)},w_{(33)},w_{(34)} ]\\)\nNow in python, using an input vector of our 4 tokens, each with an embedding dimension of 3:\n\n\ntensor([[0.8823, 0.9150, 0.3829],\n        [0.9593, 0.3904, 0.6009],\n        [0.2566, 0.7936, 0.9408],\n        [0.1332, 0.9346, 0.5936]])\n\n\nWe’ll calculate the attention vector for \\(x^{(3)}\\) as our query:\n\nquery = inputs[2]\nattention_score_for_x3 = torch.empty((4))\nfor i, xi in enumerate(inputs):\n    # Calculate the attention score for x3i\n    attention_score_for_x3[i] = torch.dot(xi, query)\n\nprint(attention_score_for_x3)\n\ntensor([1.3127, 1.1213, 1.5807, 1.3343])\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Normalizing\nNow that we’ve calculated the attention vector \\(w_3\\) for query \\(x^{(3)}\\), we have a vector with a number for every token. These numbers however are not normalized between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), which is what we’d really like. For this, we’ll use Cross-Entropy Loss, which will make sure the numbers in our attention vector add up to one and each are between \\(0 \\ldots 1\\)\n\nattention_weights_for_x3 = torch.softmax(attention_score_for_x3, dim=0)\nprint(attention_weights_for_x3)\n\ntensor([0.2407, 0.1987, 0.3146, 0.2459])\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Context Vector\nSo now that we have our normalized attention weights for a single query \\(x^{(3)}\\) we can calculate the full context vector that corresponds to \\(x^{(3)}\\)\nOur attention weights from the previous step were: \\([.2, .1, .3, .2]\\) or more in general, a vector \\([\\alpha _{31}, \\alpha _{32}, \\alpha _{33}, \\alpha _{34}]\\)\nTo calculate the context vector for \\(x^{(3)}\\) we’ll take each \\(\\alpha _{3i}\\) and multiply that by \\(x^{(i)}\\).

We’ll need to make this more scalable and figure out a way to calculate \\(z\\) for all tokens in our input sequence.\nThis means, what we have done for \\(x^{(3)}\\) we need to do for all inputs:\n\nattention_scores_manual = torch.empty((4, 4))  # for each query of the 4 inputs, calculate 4 attention scores\nfor i, query in enumerate(inputs):\n    for j, xi in enumerate(inputs):\n        attention_scores_manual[i][j] = torch.dot(query, xi)\n\nprint(\"attention scores:\")\nprint(attention_scores_manual)\nprint(\"for comparison, the attention scores for x3 as query:\")\nprint(attention_score_for_x3)\n\nattention scores:\ntensor([[1.7622, 1.4337, 1.3127, 1.1999],\n        [1.4337, 1.4338, 1.1213, 0.8494],\n        [1.3127, 1.1213, 1.5807, 1.3343],\n        [1.1999, 0.8494, 1.3343, 1.2435]])\nfor comparison, the attention scores for x3 as query:\ntensor([1.3127, 1.1213, 1.5807, 1.3343])\n\n\nUsing for loops however is slow and can’t be optimized using CUDA, so let’s find a way to do the same, but to use pure tensor calculations instead. Our inputs look like the below, with 4 tokens, each with a dimension of 3\n\n\ntensor([[0.8823, 0.9150, 0.3829],\n        [0.9593, 0.3904, 0.6009],\n        [0.2566, 0.7936, 0.9408],\n        [0.1332, 0.9346, 0.5936]])\n\n\nWe can transpose this vector, so it looks like:\n\n\ntensor([[0.8823, 0.9593, 0.2566, 0.1332],\n        [0.9150, 0.3904, 0.7936, 0.9346],\n        [0.3829, 0.6009, 0.9408, 0.5936]])\n\n\nIf we now take multiply these two matrices, we get:\n\nattention_scores = inputs @ inputs.T  # matrix multiplication\nprint(inputs @ inputs.T) # matrix multiplication\nprint(\"for comparison, the attention scores for x3 as query:\")\nprint(attention_score_for_x3)\n\ntensor([[1.7622, 1.4337, 1.3127, 1.1999],\n        [1.4337, 1.4338, 1.1213, 0.8494],\n        [1.3127, 1.1213, 1.5807, 1.3343],\n        [1.1999, 0.8494, 1.3343, 1.2435]])\nfor comparison, the attention scores for x3 as query:\ntensor([1.3127, 1.1213, 1.5807, 1.3343])\n\n\nThese are just attention scores, not yet attention weights, so lets normalize them:\n\nattention_weights = torch.softmax(attention_scores, dim=-1)  # normalize the attention scores\nprint(\"attention weights:\")\nprint(attention_weights)\nprint(\"for comparison, the attention weights for x3 as query:\")\nprint(attention_weights_for_x3)\n\nattention weights:\ntensor([[0.3415, 0.2459, 0.2179, 0.1946],\n        [0.3040, 0.3040, 0.2225, 0.1695],\n        [0.2407, 0.1987, 0.3146, 0.2459],\n        [0.2569, 0.1809, 0.2938, 0.2683]])\nfor comparison, the attention weights for x3 as query:\ntensor([0.2407, 0.1987, 0.3146, 0.2459])\n\n\nFrom here we can calculate our context vectors:\n\nall_context_vectors = attention_weights @ inputs  # matrix multiplication\nprint(\"context vectors for all inputs:\")\nprint(all_context_vectors)\nprint(\"for comparison, the context vector for x3:\")\nprint(context_vector_for_x3)\n\ncontext vectors for all inputs:\ntensor([[0.6191, 0.7634, 0.5991],\n        [0.6395, 0.7318, 0.6090],\n        [0.5165, 0.7774, 0.6536],\n        [0.5113, 0.7897, 0.6428]])\nfor comparison, the context vector for x3:\ntensor([0.5165, 0.7774, 0.6536])",

    "text": "1.2 Self-Attention with trainable weights\nFrom here we’ll expand to what is called “scaled dot-product attention”. Also here we’ll want to calculate context vectors (one for each of our input tokens) as a weighted sum over (some abstraction) of the inputs. There are some differences with what we’ve done so far though:\n\ninstead of taking directly \\(q^{(i)} = x^{(i)}\\) as the query vector, we’ll use a projection of \\(x^{(i)}\\). We do this using a trainable weight matrix \\(W_q\\), used to calculate our query\ninstead of taking directly the dot product of \\(q^{(i)}\\) and each \\(x^{(i)}\\) to calculate our attention scores and weights, we’ll do the dot product with a projection of \\(x^{(i)}\\). We do this using a trainable weight matrix \\(W_k\\), used to calculate our keys.\ninstead of calculating the weighted average using these scores with each \\(x^{(i)}\\), we’ll do this with a projection of \\(x^{(i)}\\). We do this using a trainable weight matrix \\(W_v\\), used to calculate our values.\n\nWe’ll have trainable weight matrixes: \\(W_q\\), \\(W_k\\), \\(W_v\\) so that the model, when trained can learn to use these to project respectively the query, key and value vectors.\n\n1.2.1 Single context vector (1)\nOur token embedding vectors are of a certain dimension embedding_dim = 3 in our example. We can choose to project these into another dimension, from 3 to 5 for example. (This is not usually done however, it’s likely kept the same.) For illustration purposes, let’s go with 5 here:\n\nd_in = embedding_dim\nd_out = 2\n\nW_query_1 = torch.rand((d_in, d_out))\nW_key_1 = torch.rand((d_in, d_out))\nW_value_1 = torch.rand((d_in, d_out))\n\nWe can now use \\(W_q\\), \\(W_k\\), \\(W_v\\) to project an embedding vector from it’s normal dimension into a dimension of 5. Let’s use \\(x^{(3)}\\) as an example for our query:\n\nx3 = inputs[2]\nprint(\"x3 input:\")\nprint(x3)\n\nprint(\"W_query:\")\nprint(W_query_1)\n\nquery = x3 @ W_query_1\nprint(\"projected query:\")\nprint(query)\n\nx3 input:\ntensor([0.2566, 0.7936, 0.9408])\nW_query:\ntensor([[0.8694, 0.5677],\n        [0.7411, 0.4294],\n        [0.8854, 0.5739]])\nprojected query:\ntensor([1.6442, 1.0264])\n\n\nInstead of defining our projection matrices like above, we’ll define them as pytorch parameters:\n\nW_query = torch.nn.Parameter(W_query_1, requires_grad=False)\nW_key = torch.nn.Parameter(W_key_1, requires_grad=False)\nW_value = torch.nn.Parameter(W_value_1, requires_grad=False)\n\nLet’s calculate our key and value vectors for every input token in our sentence “I am learning this”: \\(x^{(1)}\\): “I”, \\(x^{(2)}\\): “am”, \\(x^{(3)}\\): “learning”, \\(x^{(4)}\\): “this”,\n\nvalues = inputs @ W_value\nprint(\"values:\")\nprint(values)\nkeys = inputs @ W_key\nprint(\"keys:\")\nprint(keys)\n\nvalues:\ntensor([[0.6307, 0.4225],\n        [0.5699, 0.3401],\n        [0.8266, 0.2332],\n        [0.6742, 0.2259]])\nkeys:\ntensor([[0.5956, 1.2759],\n        [0.5394, 1.2740],\n        [0.5617, 1.2937],\n        [0.4637, 0.9897]])\n\n\nNow we can calculate the attention scores, for our query vector that got projected from \\(x^{(3)}\\)\n\n\nquery projection from x3:\ntensor([1.6442, 1.0264])\n\n\nThe attention score \\(w_{31}\\) is:\n\nx1 = inputs[0]\nprint(\"x1 input:\")\nprint(x1)\nprint(\"key projection from x1: \")\nkey = x1 @ W_key\nprint(key)\nprint(\"... which is the same as: \")\nprint(keys[0])  # keys[0] is the key for x1\n\nprint(\"attention score between our query and x1's projected key:\")\nattention_score_x3_x1 = query.dot(key)\nprint(attention_score_x3_x1)\n\nx1 input:\ntensor([0.8823, 0.9150, 0.3829])\nkey projection from x1: \ntensor([0.5956, 1.2759])\n... which is the same as: \ntensor([0.5956, 1.2759])\nattention score between our query and x1's projected key:\ntensor(2.2888)\n\n\nIn the same way as we got the attention score between the query and x1, we can get all attention scores for our query like this:\n\nattention_scores_x3_as_query = query @ keys.T\nprint(\"attention scores for x3 as query:\")\nprint(attention_scores_x3_as_query)\n\nattention scores for x3 as query:\ntensor([2.2888, 2.1945, 2.2514, 1.7783])\n\n\nAs is shown above, for our chosen query, we’ll end up with 4 attention scores: one for each input token. Like before, we’ll want to normalize our attention scores into attention weights but instead of doing a pure softmax function, we’ll first scale the attention scores by dividing them by the square root of the dimension of our projected keys (2 in this case).\n\nprint(\"dimension of our projected key: \", d_out)\nscaled_attention_weights_x3_as_query = \\\n  torch.softmax(attention_scores_x3_as_query / d_out**0.5, dim=-1)\nprint(\"scaled attention weights for x3 as query:\")\nprint(scaled_attention_weights_x3_as_query)\n\ndimension of our projected key:  2\nscaled attention weights for x3 as query:\ntensor([0.2773, 0.2594, 0.2700, 0.1933])\n\n\nWe don’t have our full context vector yet. For that we’ll still need to make a weighted combination of our projected value vectors. Before we do so, let’s digress a little on the need for scaling the softmax.\n\n\n1.2.2 Why scaling?\nAs the dimension for our projected key vector grows, the dot products can become large numbers.

On the opposite side, if \\(p\\) is close to 0.95 for example, then it would be fairly obvious to dinstinguish between both distributions by observing a series of outcomes.\nTo quantitatively measure the difference between two distributions we can look if a given sequence would be equally probably in both. If they assign similar probabilities to similar sequences that implies both are very similar.\nWe can generate observations using coin 1 then calculating the probability of coin 2 generating the observations. Then we can compare that probability to the probability of coin 1. If those are similar, then the distribution is similar or vice versa. We could then take the following ratio: \\[\\frac{P_{\\text{observations from coin 1}}}{P_{\\text{observations from coin 2}}}\\]\nLet’s say our fair coin has probabilities: \\[\\begin{cases}p_{1} & \\text{for heads} \\\\ p_{2} & \\text{for tails} \\end{cases}\\]\nWe flip this coin \\(n\\) times: H T T H H\nThen we work out the probability of coin 1 generating this sequence. To do this we multiply by \\(p_{1}\\) when we see heads and by \\(p_{2}\\) when we see tails: \\(p_{1} \\cdot p_{2} \\cdot p_{2} \\cdot p_{1} \\cdot p_{1}\\)\nOur biased coin has probabilities: \\[\\begin{cases}q_{1} & \\text{for heads} \\\\ q_{2} & \\text{for tails} \\end{cases}\\]\nLet’s work out the probably of coin 2 generating this sequence. In a similar way this is: \\(q_{1} \\cdot q_{2} \\cdot q_{2} \\cdot q_{1} \\cdot q_{1}\\)\nIf \\(N_{H}\\) is the number of times we got heads and \\(N_{T}\\) is the number of times we got tails, we can simplify both as: \\[P(\\text{observations from coin 1})=p_{1}^{N_{H}}\\cdot p_{2}^{N_{T}}\\] and in the biased distribution: \\[P(\\text{observations from coin 2})=q_{1}^{N_{H}}\\cdot q_{2}^{N_{T}}\\]\nCalculating the ratio of both:\n\\[\\frac{P_{\\text{observations from coin 1}}}{P_{\\text{observations from coin 2}}}=\\frac{p_{1}^{N_{H}}p_{2}^{N_{T}}}{q_{1}^{N_{H}}q_{2}^{N_{T}}}\\]\nLet’s normalize this for sample size by raising this to the power of \\(\\frac{1}{N}\\): \\[\\left(\\frac{p_{1}^{N_{H}}p_{2}^{N_{T}}}{q_{1}^{N_{H}}q_{2}^{N_{T}}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{N}}\\]\nNow let’s take the log of this expression:\n\\[log \\left(\\frac{p_{1}^{N_{H}}p_{2}^{N_{T}}}{q_{1}^{N_{H}}q_{2}^{N_{T}}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{N}}\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{N} log \\left(\\frac{p_{1}^{N_{H}}p_{2}^{N_{T}}}{q_{1}^{N_{H}}q_{2}^{N_{T}}}\\right)\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{N} \\left( log\\,p_{1}^{N_{H}} + log\\,p_{2}^{N_{T}} - log\\,q_{1}^{N_{H}} -  log\\,q_{2}^{N_{T}} \\right)\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{N}log\\,p_{1}^{N_{H}} + \\frac{1}{N}log\\,p_{2}^{N_{T}} - \\frac{1}{N}log\\,q_{1}^{N_{H}} - \\frac{1}{N}log\\,q_{2}^{N_{T}}\\] \\[=\\frac{N_{H}}{N}log\\,p_{1} + \\frac{N_{T}}{N}log\\,p_{2} - \\frac{N_{H}}{N}log\\,q_{1} - \\frac{N_{T}}{N}log\\,q_{2}\\] \\[=p_{1}log\\,p_{1} + p_{2}log\\,p_{2} - p_{1}log\\,q_{1} - p_{2}log\\,q_{2}\\] \\[=p_{1}log\\,p_{1} - p_{1}log\\,q_{1} + p_{2}log\\,p_{2} - p_{2}log\\,q_{2}\\] \\[=p_{1}log\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}} + p_{2}log\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}\\]\nNote how this formula is the formula for KL divergence.",
